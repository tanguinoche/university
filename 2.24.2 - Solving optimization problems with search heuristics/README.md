#Solving Optimization Problems with Search Heuristics

#Objectives of the course:

The current MPRI offer contains courses on different algorithmic problems, for which solutions are designed that are tailored to the problem at hand. These solutions are often exact, and their optimization times ideally (close to being) best possible. In this course we want to give a complementary view on algorithmics in computer science. We present general purpose heuristics which are widely applied to solve real-world optimization challenges, such as local search algorithms and randomizes search heuristics like Simulated Annealing and evolutionary algorithms. Our course focuses on the theoretical aspects of this area. Runtime bounds, complexity statements, and approximation ratios are rigorously proven in the course.

#Prerequisites

Some background on algorithms and probability theory (e.g., expected value, binomial distribution).

#Outline of the course:

The course starts with a summary of solution techniques and problems that the students might have seen in their studies, for example local search algorithms for facility location. Then we introduce formally a few different popular heuristic approaches, such as random sampling, local search, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms. Theoretical background from both deterministic and randomized algorithm analysis will be introduced. Students will see how to apply them to show lower bounds and upper bounds on the performance of the different heuristics. Finally, we given an illustrative example, highlighting how to use insights from this course to design new efficient problem solvers.
